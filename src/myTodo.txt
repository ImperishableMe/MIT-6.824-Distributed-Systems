For better:
-> sending RPC to all peers with same arguments
-> each rpc should be sent(and handled) in
    its own go routine
-> applyCh should use conditional variable



-> updateCommitIndex should have a term argument
-> implement string for structures
-> appendentries should be sent in 2 cases: heartbeats, start()
